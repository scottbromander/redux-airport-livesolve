# Redux Airport

`Fork`, `Clone`, and `npm install` to get started.

## Base Requirements

- Add Redux to the project. The array of airlines should be stored inside of the redux state.
- Create a form with one input for an airline name. When the user hits an `Add Airline`, button, add that new airline to the table.

## Stretch Goals

- Add a second input for the number of planes the airline has at this airport.
